# Voice Features Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds voice output capabilities to the car diagnostic agent system using Azure Cognitive Services. The features are implemented in a way that doesn't break existing functionality - if Azure credentials are not provided, the voice features are simply disabled.

## Features Added

### 1. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Backend endpoint: `POST /text-to-speech` 
- Frontend hook: `useVoice()` with `speakText()` function
- Auto-speaking of short AI responses
- Manual speaking of any text

### 2. Voice Service Status
- Backend endpoint: `GET /voice-status`
- Frontend: Automatic detection of voice availability

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Python)
- **File**: `app/azure_voice_service.py`
- Uses Azure Speech SDK with graceful fallback
- Defensive imports to prevent breaking existing functionality
- Neural voice quality (en-US-DavisNeural)

### Frontend (React)
- **Hook**: `src/hooks/useVoice.ts`
- **Integration**: Modified `ChatInterface.tsx` to include voice output button
- Auto-speaks short AI responses (< 300 characters)

### API Endpoints Added
- `POST /text-to-speech` - Convert text to audio WAV
- `GET /voice-status` - Check if voice service is available

## Setup Instructions

### Enabling Voice Features
1. Set Azure credentials as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_azure_speech_key
   export AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_region  # e.g., eastus
   ```

2. Install Azure SDK (already done):
   ```bash
   pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
   ```

### Without Azure Credentials
The system works perfectly without voice features if Azure credentials are not provided. The voice service simply reports as unavailable.

## Usage

### Automatic Voice Output
Short AI responses (under 300 characters) are automatically spoken when received.

### Manual Voice Output
Click the speaker icon next to the send button to speak any text in the input field.

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if Azure SDK is not available
- Graceful degradation if Azure credentials are not set
- Proper error handling for network and audio playback issues
- No impact on existing functionality if voice features fail

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Backend loads without Azure SDK
- ✅ Backend loads without Azure credentials
- ✅ Frontend compiles without errors
- ✅ Existing OBD functionality unchanged
- ✅ Voice features work when Azure is configured
